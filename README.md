  I worked daily (most often as part of a small team) designing mock-ups and developing 
  a web solution that is both responsive and cross-browser compatible to match client needs. 
  I was able to work under pressure, with little to no supervision and consistently meet deadlines. 
  I gained valuable knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript throughout this role.

Project Experience
------------------

- Jun 2019: **Cryptocurrency Web Scraper**, [github.com/brandanmcdevitt/crypto.scraper](https://github.com/brandanmcdevitt/crypto.scraper)
    + I created a web scraping tool with Python that visits coinmarketcap.com and scrapes data on each cryptocurrency coin.
    + The tool loops through the html and any relevant data is pulled and written to a .csv file.
    + I then converted the data into JSON.
    + Unit-tests have been written to ensure that coin data is being correctly stored and returned.
    + Skills: Python
- Jun 2019: **Monopoly Simulator**, [github.com/brandanmcdevitt/monopoly.simulator](https://github.com/brandanmcdevitt/monopoly.simulator)
    + I’m working on a CLI version of Monopoly built on Python to exercise and ingrain knowledge and skills learned from a Python course that I have taken.
    + The game takes a number of users between 2 and 6, asks for their name and token and begins playing. On each turn a dice is rolled, and the player is informed on how many spaces to turn. If a double has been rolled the player will get another turn unless doubles has been rolled 3 times, in which case the player will be sent to jail and will not be allowed to return to the game unless they roll a double or wait 3 turns. If a player reaches $0, they will be removed from the game. The game ends when there is only 1 player left with a positive balance.
    + Making use of OOP by way of classes and inheritance for players, the dice and the game board.
    + Writing unit-tests to ensure functionality of the game.
    + Skills: Python
- Sep 2018 - Jun 2019: **PetsBack**, [github.com/brandanmcdevitt/petsback](https://github.com/brandanmcdevitt/petsback)
    + Developed a web application and iOS application to help return missing pets to their owners for my final year project.
    + The back-end was built using Python, with Flask and Jinja to display information on the front-end.
    + Incorporated Firebase for storing user information and pet details.
    + Implemented machine learning to recognise pet breeds from an image uploaded by the user.
    + QR code generation was integrated to embed the owners contact details in a versatile scannable medium that could be attached to the pet’s collars.
    + AWS Buckets were used to store images of pets and generated QR codes.
    + I used Swift to develop the iOS application, which pulls information from firebase to display to the user.
- Sep 2018: **Mentoring the Future**, [github.com/brandanmcdevitt/CS50.Harvard](https://github.com/brandanmcdevitt/CS50.Harvard/tree/master/project)
    + I created a web application for my final project in the HarvardX – CS50 course with the idea that teachers could sign up and offer mentoring time slots for students.
    + I used Python for the back-end of the web app to query the database, pass data to the front-end, validate user input and ensure the integrity of the log in system.
    + Skills: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
